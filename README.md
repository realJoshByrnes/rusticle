# Rusticle

**Minimal. Executable. Rusticle.**

Rusticle is a byte-sized Windows executable written in pure Rust, designed to explore how small a functional `.exe` can beâ€”without sacrificing clarity, correctness, or control. This project began with a standard `cargo new` application that printed `"Hello, world!"`, producing a 134,144-byte binary on Windows (Rust 1.88.0). Through a series of deliberate, incremental changes, we reduced that footprint dramaticallyâ€”without introducing any dependencies or compromising readability.

Each commit in this repository represents a single optimization step, accompanied by a version bump and a clear explanation. From tuning compiler flags to removing the VC runtime, from stripping symbols to redefining the entry point, every decision was made with precision and purpose.

## ðŸ§­ Guiding Principles

- âœ… Use the default Rust toolchain and linker
- âœ… Keep the code readable and maintainable
- âœ… Avoid all external dependencies
- âœ… Introduce features only when implemented
- âœ… Measure and document every change

## ðŸ“Š Version History & Binary Size

This table tracks the evolution of Rusticle across versions, showing how each change impacted the final `.exe` size on both `x86_64` and `i686` architectures.

## ðŸš€ What Rusticle Demonstrates

- How to build a minimal Windows executable in Rust
- How to progressively reduce binary size without sacrificing clarity
- How to remove runtime dependencies like the VC runtime
- How to control the PE layout and entry point manually
- How to write Rust that feels like shellcodeâ€”but compiles like a dream

## ðŸ“¦ Final Outcome

The final binary is a fraction of its original size, with no external dependencies, no runtime, and no standard library. It executes cleanly, exits predictably, and leaves behind nothing but admiration for what Rust can do when stripped to its essence.

## ðŸ’¡ Further reductions

### Potential `.reloc` Section Removal (i686)

The `.reloc` section currently occupies 56 bytes that can be removed

- **16 bytes** of relocation data
- **40 bytes** of section header metadata

This section can be removed entirely by setting either of the following linker flags:

```
/FIXED
/DYNAMICBASE:NO
```

Doing so disables relocation support, meaning the binary must be loaded at its preferred base address. This saves space and disables ASLR, which may be acceptable for ultra-minimal binaries.

However, Iâ€™ve chosen **not** to apply these flags by default, because removing relocations can cause runtime failures if the preferred base address is already occupied. In such cases, the loader will fail with:

```
STATUS_CONFLICTING_ADDRESSES (0xC0000018)
```

This trade-off favors compatibility over minimal size in this build.
